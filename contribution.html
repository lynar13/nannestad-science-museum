                    <p>
                        A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the 
                            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. 
                            <br><br>Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the 
                            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
                             monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to 
                             discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
                            <br><br>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. 
                            Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how 
                            you can get involved.
