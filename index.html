            <p>Come join us at the <span class="nan">Nannestad</span> <span>Science Museum</span> where we’re committed 
            to making science accessible to all. Over the course of human history, 
            science has developed from our 
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring 
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of 
            life itself.</p>
            <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience 
                the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion 
                to continue the exploration of the world around us.

                        <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
