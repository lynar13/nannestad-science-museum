                    <h2>Cosmology</h2>
                    <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 
                    ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can 
                    see and know about the universe around us. 
                    <br>
                    We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that 
                        can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who 
                        used the stars to travel by.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early 
                        Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest 
                        exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with 
                    the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how
                    did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution 
                    we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today 
                    have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the 
                    creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
                    </p>

                <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology 
                    are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of 
                    life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.
                    Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a 
                    look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin 
                    and the first heart transplant. 
                    <br>
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, 
                    but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures 
                    have beat us to it.

                    <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence 
                    are the science of the future. From useful home applications of AI to 
                    industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello 
                    and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, 
                    the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a 
                    sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
                    In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently 
                    face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. 
                    But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
