                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 
                    ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can 
                    see and know about the universe around us. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that 
                        can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who 
                        used the stars to travel by.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early 
                        Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest 
                        exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with 
                    the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how
                    did we get here? 
                    <br><br>Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution 
                    we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today 
                    have evolved our time. 
                    <br><br>You can also take some time to meet a few of the 
                    creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology 
                    are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of 
                    life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.
                    <br><br>Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a 
                    look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin 
                    and the first heart transplant. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, 
                    but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures 
                    have beat us to it.

                <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, 
                the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. 
                It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the 
                power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering 
                lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and 
                control wind to create power.
